         <p>The first solo album from David Lynch, 2011's <i>Crazy Clown Time</i>, features a song called "Good Day Today." The lyrics called out to me at the time of his death: </p>
         <p class="single-blogpost-heading">"Good Day Today" <br>(written by David Lynch and Dean Justin Harley)</p>

<div class="lyrics">
So tired of fire, so tired of smoke
Send me an angel, save me
I wanna have a good day today
Good day today
Tired of drowning, goes so low
Send me an angel, save me
So tired of, so tired of
Send me an angel, save me
I wanna have a good day today
Good day today
So tired of fearing, so tired of dark
Send me an angel, save me
I wanna have a good day today
Good day today

      <p class="single-blogpost-heading">California Wildfires</p>
      <p>Shortly before his passing, David Lynch was evacuated from his Los Angeles home due to the devastating wildfires. His home, which also housed his beloved studio, was his personal sanctuary where he dedicated himself to his art. Following his emphysema diagnosis in 2024, Lynch's health deteriorated, exacerbated by the smoke-filled air from the
      wildfires in the region.</p>
      <p>Some of his fans referenced this song while pondering his life and the state of the world leading up to his final farewell. A devoted Californian, the landscape often served as a key source of inspiration, with films like <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, <i>Lost Highway</i>, and <i>Inland Empire</i>, all set in Los Angeles. Smoke and fire were also key elements associated in his work, such as <i>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</i>. In light of these events, "Good Day Today" takes on a poignant new meaning. Not only did it seem that the L.A. he once knew was dying with him, the track evokes a sense of transition, as if Lynch
      is acknowledging that his physical environment could no longer sustain him, and he is looking towards a different kind of home: one of peace and healing. </p>
      <p>I truly believe David Lynch is experiencing one good day after another now.</p>
